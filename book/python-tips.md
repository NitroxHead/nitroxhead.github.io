# Python Tips for Productive Development

*Published: March 30, 2024*

Here are some Python tips and tricks I've gathered over the years that have made my development workflow more efficient and my code cleaner.

## List Comprehensions vs Loops

One of Python's most powerful features is list comprehensions. They're not just more concise than traditional loops - they're often faster too.

```python
# Instead of this
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i**2)

# Use this
squares = [i**2 for i in range(10)]
```

## Context Managers Are Your Friend

The `with` statement isn't just for file handling - it's a powerful pattern for resource management.

```python
# Custom context manager
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def timer():
    start = time.time()
    yield
    print(f"Execution time: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")

with timer():
    # Your code here
    expensive_operation()
```

These small improvements add up to make your Python code more readable and maintainable.
