# Jupyter Notebooks for Data Analysis

*Published: March 20, 2024*

Jupyter Notebooks have revolutionized how we approach data science and exploratory programming. Here's my take on best practices and common pitfalls to avoid.

## The Power of Interactive Computing

Notebooks excel at:
- Rapid prototyping and experimentation
- Creating narrative-driven analysis
- Sharing reproducible research

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Quick data exploration
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df.head()
```

## Best Practices I've Learned

1. **Keep notebooks focused** - One analysis per notebook
2. **Document your thinking** - Use markdown cells liberally
3. **Clean up before sharing** - Remove debugging cells and outputs

The key is treating notebooks as a communication tool, not just a development environment.
